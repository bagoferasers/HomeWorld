Personal Use Closed Source Creative Tools License 2021-02-12

Nobody likes license agreements, so I will keep things as short as I can!

Please respect the work and effort that goes into creating better tools for everyone to create with, so:
- Do not resell or redistribute this tool, and you do not sell derivative/modified versions of this tool.
- This tool is meant exclusively for personal use. You cannot ship this tool as part of a commercial product or use it to provide commercial services. If you are interested in using this tool in a commercial context, please contact me.
- Do not decompile or reverse-engineer this tool in order to retrieve its source code or make modifications.

This license agreement might be updated in the future to rephrase and clarify things, as well as counteract unintended use of my work.

Thank you,
Mark
